A first look at Well Objects
============================

**This page is under development.**

This tutorial introduces the classes relating to wells and goes into more detail for some of the basic ones. Other tutorials will cover the remaining well classes in depth.

The RESQML and resqpy classes for wells
---------------------------------------

The RESQML standard contains several classes of object that relate to wells. Each of these has an equivalent resqpy class, named (in parenthesis) in this list:

* MdDatum (MdDatum) - a simple class holding a datum location for measured depths
* DeviationSurveyRepresentation (DeviationSurvey) - inclination and azimuth at given measured depths
* WellboreTrajectoryRepresentation (Trajectory) - xyz coordinates at given measured depths
* WellboreFrameRepresentation (WellboreFrame) - list of measured depths supporting well log properties
* WellboreMarkerFrameRepresentation (WellboreMarkerFrame) - list of picks (well markers)
* BlockedWellboreRepresentation (BlockedWell) - list of cells visited or perforated by a well

The resqpy WellboreFrame and BlockedWell support related properties, which can be handled with the PropertyCollection and/or Property classes. However, for working with well logs, the resqpy property module includes the following classes for convenience:

* (WellLogCollection) - for managing logs, including a method for exporting in LAS format
* (WellLog) - for simpler access to a single log

RESQML also has organisational classes relating to wells:

* WellboreFeature (WellboreFeature) - a named entity representing a real, planned or conceptual well
* WellboreInterpretation (WellboreInterpretation) - one possible incarnation of a wellbore feature

There are various relationships between these classes. For example, a deviation survey or a trajectory must refer to a measured depth datum, and a blocked well must refer to a trajectory. Any of the representation objects can relate to a wellbore interpretation, which in turn must relate to a wellbore feature. The use of these optional organisational objects is encouraged and some software requires them to be present.

Most of the well related resqpy classes are contained in the `well.py` module. The feature and interpretation classes are in the `organize.py` module. Code snippets in this tutorial assume the following imports:

.. code-block:: python

    import resqpy.model as rq
    import resqpy.well as rqw
    import resqpy.organize as rqo

The measured depth datum class: MdDatum
---------------------------------------
A measured depth datum is a simple object which locates the datum for measured depths within a coordinate reference system. A direct reference to an MD datum is required in both a deviation survey and a trajectory. (And the other well representation objects refer to a trajectory, so an MD datum is always needed.)

When reading an existing dataset, a resqpy MdDatum object can be instantiated in the usual way by first identifying the required uuid. In this example we follow relationships from an interpretation object:

.. code-block:: python

    model = rq.Model('existing_model.epc')
    pq13b_sidetrack_interpretation_uuid = model.uuid(obj_type = 'WellboreInterpretation',
                                                     title = 'PQ13B_SIDETRACK')
    assert pq13b_sidetrack_interpretation_uuid is not None
    pq13b_sidetrack_survey_uuid = model.uuid(obj_type = 'DeviationSurveyRepresentation',
                                             related_uuid = pq13b_sidetrack_interpretation_uuid)
    assert pq13b_sidetrack_survey_uuid is not None
    pq13_md_datum_uuid = model.uuid(obj_type = 'MdDatum', related_uuid = pq13b_sidetrack_survey_uuid)
    assert pq13_md_datum_uuid is not None
    pq13_md_datum = rqw.MdDatum(model, uuid = pq13_md_datum_uuid)

The MdDatum class doesn't have any exciting methods. Code accessing such an object will usually simply refer to some of the attributes, such as:

* crs_uuid: the uuid of the coordinate reference system within which the datum is located
* location: a triple float being the xyz location of the datum
* md_reference: a human readable string from a prescribed set, such as 'mean sea level', or 'kelly bushing'

Creating a new measured depth datum object
------------------------------------------
Most of the tutorials so far have focussed on reading existing data. As the MdDatum is such a simple object, it is a good place to start looking at how we create new objects using resqpy. In this example, we will add a new MdDatum, located five metres to the east and two metres north of the existing datum which we identified above:

.. code-block:: python

    # prepare whatever data we need to populate the new object
    pq13_location = np.array(pq13_md_datum.location)
    new_location = tuple(pq13_location + (5.0, 2.0, 0.0))

    # instantiate the resqpy object using data
    pq14_md_datum = rqw.MdDatum(model,
                                crs_uuid = pq13_md_datum.crs_uuid,
                                location = new_location,
                                md_reference = pq13_md_datum.md_reference,
                                title = 'PQ14')

    #Â the md datum class does not involve any arrays, so no need to write anything to hdf5

    # create an xml tree (in memory) and add it to the model's dictionary of parts
    pq14_md_datum.create_xml()

    # update the epc file on disc (more typically done after creating all the new objects)
    model.store_epc()

Note that for a real well that has been drilled, the actual location of the datum should be available from the drilling information, so the example above is rather unrealistic.

Other resqpy objects can be created in a similar way. Note, however:

* most classes are much more complex than MdDatum, so much more data needs to be prepared
* resqpy includes import options for some classes, for reading the data from other formats
* many classes include array data, which require an extra step writing to the hdf5 file
